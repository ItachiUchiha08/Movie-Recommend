# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** is a content-based filtering application that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It utilizes the **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset** from Kaggle and provides an interactive frontend built with **Streamlit**.

## Features
- Content-based filtering using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
- Similarity computation using **Cosine Similarity**.
- Interactive and user-friendly **Streamlit** interface.
- Movie search functionality.
- Displays recommended movie posters and details.

## Dataset
The project uses the **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset**, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). The dataset includes:
- Movie titles
- Overview (plot summary)
- Genres
- Cast & Crew
- Keywords and tags

### Steps to Install

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash

   ```

## Usage
1. Open the **Streamlit UI** in your browser.
2. Search for a movie in the input field.
3. The system will return a list of recommended movies based on content similarity.
4. View movie posters and details alongside recommendations.


## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data processing
- **Scikit-learn** for vectorization and similarity calculations
- **Streamlit** for frontend
- **Requests** for fetching additional movie data

## Future Enhancements
- Hybrid filtering (combining collaborative & content-based)
- Personalized user profiles
- Integration with a movie database API for real-time updates
